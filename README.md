# voronoi-vis
An interactive tool for drawing graphical a Voronoi diagram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). Uses a brute force method of calculating point colours, based on Euclidean distance.

Instead of brute force, an optimisation would be to use Fortune's algorithm - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm
